# CISII_DeformationSuturingAMBF
This is the CIS 2 project by Veronica Kidwell and Shalika Subramanian creating a deformable suturing simulation in AMBF.

This is created using AMBF: https://github.com/WPI-AIM/ambf
To be used with the Surgical Robotics Challenge: https://github.com/surgical-robotics-ai/surgical_robotics_challenge

Most up-to-date results can be run using the process described in the Surgical Robotics Challenge GitHub with the command ./run_softbody_needle.sh
